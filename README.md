# couchmail.py

**Very** early stage email archiver for Apache CouchDB
and Cloudant.

## Installation

Copy `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini`.
Customize it.

    $ pip install easyimap couchdb
    $ python import.py

Hope for the best!

It *should* export the number of emails you specify,
store them by their `Message-ID` header value (or
timestamp...if `Message-ID` is missing).

## Design Doc (aka CouchApp)

    $ cd couchapp
    $ couchapp push . http://user:pass@localhost:5984/mail

Note: `erica` should also work.

#### Full-Text Search

The Design Doc includes basic MapReduce for counting things (see Futon, Fauxton, or the Cloudant Dashboard for more).

It also includes some [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com/) specific Full-Text Search indexes. These indexes let you search email addresses, subject lines, and message bodies.

Here are some examplesâ€¦

Search for "fauxton":

```
/couchdb-mailing-lists/_design/couchmail/_search/mail?q=fauxton
```

Count those results by `subject`, `to`, and `from`:

```
/couchdb-mailing-lists/_design/couchmail/_search/mail?q=fauxton&counts=["subject", "to", "from"]
```

Now drilldown those results to just what I've posted:

```
/couchdb-mailing-lists/_design/couchmail/_search/mail?q=fauxton&counts=["subject", "to", "from"]&drilldown=["from", "Benjamin Young <byoung@bigbluehat.com>"]
```

### API (work-in-progress)

The API is built using [aspen.io](http://aspen.io/) and it's sole purpose is to provide email obfuscation. If you don't need to obfuscate email addresses (as you're hosting this locally or some such), then don't bother with the API dir. ^_^

Otherwise, run this:

```
$ cd api/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-external Cheroot --allow-unverified Cheroot
$ # sorry about the Cheroot stuff...
$ python -m aspen.server
```

`http://localhost:8080/fauxton` (where `fauxton` is your favorite search terem) should get you some search results.
